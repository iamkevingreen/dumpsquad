## Enterprise Grade Security Protection

Our team is very conscious about security. Socure's Social ID Verification service is hosted in managed data-center environments with military grade physical security and component isolation behind incremental firewalls and IDS/IPS services. We do not store personal information about users and all sensitive information in our system is encrypted using the strongest crypto available in the market today.

Our REST and SOAP API services are hosted at SSL-secured endpoints. We ensure non-repudiation and authorized access to our service. We also employ best practice horizontal infrastructure scaling and API bandwidth shaping techniques to meet our SLAs. Our services are also audited to ensure compliance.
